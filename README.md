## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-flashcard-generator
cd ai-flashcard-generator

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:5173`

### API Setup

This application uses **Claude API** (Anthropic) for AI generation:

1. Get an API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

**Note:** The current version uses a direct API call. For production, implement a backend proxy to protect your API key.
